  # repo: https://github.com/carlos-collado/phi2FM # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  # url: "https://github.com/carlos-collado/phi2FM"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Techniques to reduce model size and compute load (e.g., EfficientViT, DynamicViT, NViT) of ViTs for EO.
